Data science combines statistics, programming, and domain knowledge to extract insights from data. Predictive models can forecast trends, detect anomalies, and support decision-making. Clustering algorithms group similar data points, while classification assigns labels to new instances based on learned patterns. Dimensionality reduction techniques, like PCA, help simplify complex datasets and improve model performance.

Natural language processing (NLP) allows machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Sentiment analysis identifies opinions in text, and topic modeling discovers hidden themes across documents. Reinforcement learning agents interact with environments to maximize rewards, often used in robotics and game AI.

Data cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming features are critical for accurate modeling. Ensemble methods, such as random forests and boosting, combine multiple models to improve prediction accuracy. Machine learning applications span e-commerce, healthcare, finance, transportation, and smart cities, highlighting the importance of efficient data indexing and retrieval for large-scale systems.
